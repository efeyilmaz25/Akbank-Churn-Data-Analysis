# Akbank-Churn-Data-Analysis
A telecommunications company aims to reduce customer churn by better understanding its customers 
and optimizing its services according to their needs. The company's analytics team wants to develop 
a model to use existing customer data to predict which customers are most likely to churn.

This data set was collected to help build this model. The data set includes various characteristics 
of customers, such as their age, purchase amounts, whether they have an account manager, the length 
of their relationship with the company, and the number of sites they use. Using these features, it 
can be predicted whether customers will churn the service.

On the data set; Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Cleaning and Preprocessing, Basic Statistical 
Analyzes, Visualization, Analysis of Relationships Between Variables, Feature Selection and Feature 
Engineering were carried out.

numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn libraries were used throughout the project.
